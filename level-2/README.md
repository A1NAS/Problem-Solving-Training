# Problem Solving Training
Problem solving training for computer science students.

<br>

## [Level 2](https://github.com/cs-MohamedAyman/Problem-Solving-Training/tree/master/level-2)

This level simply consists of 16 sheets, 6 sheets of them on Codeforces Online Judge, 4 sheets of them on LeetCode Online Judge, plus 4 sheets on HackerEarth Online Judge, and the last 2 sheets on HackerRank Online Judge.

## Prerequisites

The prerequisites for level 2 of this training are the basic knowledge for Data Structures and Algorithms like ***(Linear Data Structures - Non-Linear Data Structures - Searching Algorithms - Sorting Algorithms)***.

	<summary>Codeforces OJ sheets description</summary>

The Codeforces OJ sheets [phase-2-1](https://github.com/cs-MohamedAyman/Problem-Solving-Training/tree/master/level-2/codeforces-phase-2-1), [phase-2-2](https://github.com/cs-MohamedAyman/Problem-Solving-Training/tree/master/level-2/codeforces-phase-2-2), [phase-2-3](https://github.com/cs-MohamedAyman/Problem-Solving-Training/tree/master/level-2/codeforces-phase-2-3), [phase-2-4](https://github.com/cs-MohamedAyman/Problem-Solving-Training/tree/master/level-2/codeforces-phase-2-4) contain B-Div2 problems, and each sheet of them divided into 5 classes of problems (Data Structure - Mathematics - String - Greedy - Brute Force). These sheets were ordered based on the problem difficulty and grouped by the problem type. Finally, each sheet contains ~120 problems. For the last 2 sheets [phase-2-div3-contests](https://github.com/cs-MohamedAyman/Problem-Solving-Training/tree/master/level-2/codeforces-phase-2-div3-contests) that focus on div3-contests (easy contests) and contains ~50 contests, and [phase-2-educational-contests](https://github.com/cs-MohamedAyman/Problem-Solving-Training/tree/master/level-2/codeforces-phase-2-educational-contests), that focus on educational-contests (medium contests) and contains ~100 contests.

### Notes

* If the student has a target to compete in the programming competitions like ***ACM-ICPC or Google Code-jam or Google Kick-start or Facebook Hackercup***, so it's recommended to start with ***Codeforces sheets*** and ***AtCoder sheets***, but if (s)he has a target to practice on ***a specific topic or preparing for an interview***, so it's recommended to start with ***HackerEarth sheets*** and ***HackerRank sheets*** and ***LeetCode sheets***.
* On each one of these sheets has an excel sheet to record your effort and enhance your progress, The time estimate for level problems is between ***30 min to 45 min*** for each problem, including ***reading time, thinking time, coding time, debugging time, and learning time***.
