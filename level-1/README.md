## [`HackerRank OJ sheets`](https://github.com/cs-MohamedAyman/Problem-Solving-Training/tree/master/level-1/README.md)

The HackerRank OJ sheets [phase-1-cpp](https://github.com/cs-MohamedAyman/Problem-Solving-Training/tree/master/level-1/hackerrank-phase-1-cpp) This sheet focus on c/c++ basic problems, It's divided into 8 classes of problems (Introduction - Conditionals and Loops - Arrays and Strings - Functions - Standard Template Libraries - Structs and Enums - Classes and Inheritance - Misc). It was ordered based on the problem difficulty and grouped by the problem type. Finally, this sheet contains ~70 problems. [phase-1-python](https://github.com/cs-MohamedAyman/Problem-Solving-Training/tree/master/level-1/hackerrank-phase-1-python) This sheet focus on python basic problems, It's divided into 6 classes of problems (Introduction - Basic Data Types - Collections - Functions - Standard Libraries - Classes). It was ordered based on the problem difficulty and grouped by the problem type. Finally, this sheet contains ~100 problems.

## `Notes`

* If the student has a target to compete in the programming competitions like ***ACM-ICPC or Google CodeJam or Google KickStart or Facebook Hackercup or TopCoder Open TCO***, so it's recommended to start with ***Codeforces sheets***, ***TopCoder sheets*** and ***AtCoder sheets***, but if (s)he has a target to practice on ***a specific topic or preparing for an interview***, so it's recommended to start with ***HackerEarth sheets***, ***HackerRank sheets***, ***AlgoExpert sheets*** and ***LeetCode sheets***.
* On each one of these sheets has an excel sheet to record your effort and enhance your progress, The time estimate for level problems is between ***30 min to 45 min*** for each problem, including ***reading time, thinking time, coding time, debugging time, and learning time***.
