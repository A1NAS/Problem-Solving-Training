## [`Level 1`](https://github.com/cs-MohamedAyman/Problem-Solving-Training/tree/master/level-1/README.md)

This level simply consists of 11 sheets, 4 sheets of them on Codeforces Online Judge, plus 4 sheets on HackerEarth Online Judge, and the last 3 sheets on HackerRank Online Judge.

## `Prerequisites`

The prerequisites for level 1 of this training are the basic knowledge for any programming language like ***(Variable Types - Basic Operators - Conditions - Loops - Functions - Lists/Arrays - Strings)***.

### `Notes`

* If the student has a target to compete in the programming competitions like ***ACM-ICPC or Google Code-jam or Google Kick-start or Facebook Hackercup***, so it's recommended to start with ***Codeforces sheets*** and ***AtCoder sheets***, but if (s)he has a target to practice on ***a specific topic or preparing for an interview***, so it's recommended to start with ***HackerEarth sheets*** and ***HackerRank sheets*** and ***LeetCode sheets***.
* On each one of these sheets has an excel sheet to record your effort and enhance your progress, The time estimate for level problems is between ***30 min to 45 min*** for each problem, including ***reading time, thinking time, coding time, debugging time, and learning time***.
