## [`Level 3`](https://github.com/cs-MohamedAyman/Problem-Solving-Training/tree/master/level-3/README.md)

This level simply consists of 19 sheets, 7 sheets of them on Codeforces Online Judge, 4 sheets of them on LeetCode Online Judge, plus 4 sheets on HackerEarth Online Judge, and the last 4 sheets on HackerRank Online Judge.

## `Prerequisite Knowledge`
The prerequisites for level 3 of this training are the advanced knowledge for Data Structures and Algorithms Analysis like ***(Disjoint Sets - Trie - Segment Tree - Binary Indexed Tree - Divide and Conquer - Graph Algorithms - Greedy Algorithms - Dynamic Programming - Mathematical Algorithms)***.

## [`Codeforces OJ sheets`](https://github.com/cs-MohamedAyman/Problem-Solving-Training/tree/master/level-3/README.md)

The Codeforces OJ sheets [phase-3-1](https://github.com/cs-MohamedAyman/Problem-Solving-Training/tree/master/level-3/codeforces-phase-3-1), [phase-3-2](https://github.com/cs-MohamedAyman/Problem-Solving-Training/tree/master/level-3/codeforces-phase-3-2), [phase-3-3](https://github.com/cs-MohamedAyman/Problem-Solving-Training/tree/master/level-3/codeforces-phase-3-3), [phase-3-4](https://github.com/cs-MohamedAyman/Problem-Solving-Training/tree/master/level-3/codeforces-phase-3-4) contain C-Div2/A-Div1 problems, and each sheet of them divided into 7 classes of problems (Divide and Conquer - Graph - Data Structure - Mathematics - String - Greedy - Dynamic Programming). These sheets were ordered based on the problem difficulty and grouped by the problem type. Finally, each sheet contains ~120 problems. For the last 3 sheets [phase-3-div3-contests](https://github.com/cs-MohamedAyman/Problem-Solving-Training/tree/master/level-3/codeforces-phase-3-div3-contests) that focus on div3-contests (easy contests) and contains ~100 contests, and [phase-3-educational-contests](https://github.com/cs-MohamedAyman/Problem-Solving-Training/tree/master/level-3/codeforces-phase-3-educational-contests), that focus on educational-contests (medium contests) and contains ~100 contests. Finally [phase-3-gym-contests](https://github.com/cs-MohamedAyman/Problem-Solving-Training/tree/master/level-3/codeforces-phase-3-gym-contests) that focus on gym-contests that contains ~200 contests.

## `Notes`

* If the student has a target to compete in the programming competitions like ***ACM-ICPC or Google CodeJam or Google KickStart or Facebook Hackercup or TopCoder Open TCO***, so it's recommended to start with ***Codeforces sheets***, ***TopCoder sheets*** and ***AtCoder sheets***, but if (s)he has a target to practice on ***a specific topic or preparing for an interview***, so it's recommended to start with ***HackerEarth sheets***, ***HackerRank sheets***, ***AlgoExpert sheets*** and ***LeetCode sheets***.
* On each one of these sheets has an excel sheet to record your effort and enhance your progress, The time estimate for level problems is between ***30 min to 45 min*** for each problem, including ***reading time, thinking time, coding time, debugging time, and learning time***.
