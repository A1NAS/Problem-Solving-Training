# Problem-Solving-Training

Problem solving training for computer science students.

## Level 3

This level simply consists of fourteen sheets, five sheets of them on Codeforces Online Judge, plus five sheets on HackerEarth Online Judge, and the last four sheets on HackerRank Online Judge.

## Prerequisites

The prerequisites for level 3 of this training are the advanced knowledge for Data Structures and Algorithms like ***(Advanced Data Structures - Divide and Conquer Algorithms - Graph Algorithms - Greedy Algorithms - Dynamic Programming - Mathematical Algorithms)***.

## Codeforces OJ sheets

The Codeforces OJ sheets [phase-3-1](https://github.com/cs-MohamedAyman/Problem-Solving-Training/tree/master/level-3/codeforces-phase-3-1), [phase-3-2](https://github.com/cs-MohamedAyman/Problem-Solving-Training/tree/master/level-3/codeforces-phase-3-2), [phase-3-3](https://github.com/cs-MohamedAyman/Problem-Solving-Training/tree/master/level-3/codeforces-phase-3-3), [phase-3-4](https://github.com/cs-MohamedAyman/Problem-Solving-Training/tree/master/level-3/codeforces-phase-3-4) contain C-Div2/A-Div1 problems, and each sheet of them divided into 6 classes of problems (Divide and Conquer - Graph - Data Structure - Mathematics - String - Greedy - Dynamic Programming). These sheets were sorted based on difficulty and grouped by the type of problems as mentioned. Finally, each sheet contains ~100 problems. For the last sheet [phase-3-gym-contests](https://github.com/cs-MohamedAyman/Problem-Solving-Training/tree/master/level-3/codeforces-phase-3-gym-contests) that focus on gym-contests, It's divided into 5 classes of contests, that contains ~130 contests.

### Notes

* If the student has a target to compete in the programming competitions like ***ACM-ICPC or Google Codejam or Google Kick-start or Facebook Hackercup***, so it's recommended to start with ***Codeforces sheets***, but if (s)he has a target to practice on ***a specific topic or preparing for an interview***, so it's recommended to start with ***HackerEarth and HackerRank sheets***.
* On each one of these sheets has an excel sheet to record your effort and enhance your progress, The time estimate for level problems is between ***30 min to 45 min*** for each one, including ***reading time, thinking time, coding time, debugging time, and learning time***.
