# Problem-Solving-Training

Problem solving training for computer science students.

## Level 1

This [level](https://github.com/cs-MohamedAyman/Problem-Solving-Training/tree/master/level%201) simply consists of eight sheets, three of them on Codeforces OJ, plus four of them on HackerEarth OJ, and the last one on HackerRank OJ.

## Prerequisites

The prerequisites for level 1 of this training are the basic knowledge for any programming language like (Variable Types - Basic Operators - Conditions - Loops - Functions - Lists - Strings).

### Notes

* If the student has a target to compete in the programming competitions like ***ACM-ICPC or Google Codejam or Google Kick-start or Facebook Hackercup***, so it's recommended to start with ***Codeforces sheets***, but if (s)he has a target to practice on ***a specific topic or preparing for an interview***, so it's recommended to start with ***HackerEarth and HackerRank sheets***.
* On each one of these sheets has an excel sheet to record your effort and enhance your progress, The time estimate for level problems is between ***30 min to 45 min*** for each one, including ***reading time, thinking time, coding time, debugging time, and learning time***.
