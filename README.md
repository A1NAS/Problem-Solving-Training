## HackerRank OJ sheets

The HackerRank OJ sheets [phase-3-mathematics](https://github.com/cs-MohamedAyman/Problem-Solving-Training/tree/master/level-3/hackerrank-phase-3-mathematics), [phase-3-graph-greedy](https://github.com/cs-MohamedAyman/Problem-Solving-Training/tree/master/level-3/hackerrank-phase-3-graph-greedy), [phase-3-dynamic-programming](https://github.com/cs-MohamedAyman/Problem-Solving-Training/tree/master/level-3/hackerrank-phase-3-dynamic-programming), [phase-3-data-structures](https://github.com/cs-MohamedAyman/Problem-Solving-Training/tree/master/level-3/hackerrank-phase-3-data-structures), These sheets contain graph, greedy, mathematics, and dynamic programming problems, in addition to data structures. Also, these sheets were sorted based on difficulty and grouped by the type of problems as mentioned. Finally, each sheet contains ~50 problems.

### Notes

* If the student has a target to compete in the programming competitions like ***ACM-ICPC or Google Codejam or Google Kick-start or Facebook Hackercup***, so it's recommended to start with ***Codeforces sheets***, but if (s)he has a target to practice on ***a specific topic or preparing for an interview***, so it's recommended to start with ***HackerEarth and HackerRank sheets***.
* On each one of these sheets has an excel sheet to record your effort and enhance your progress, The time estimate for level problems is between ***30 min to 45 min*** for each one, including ***reading time, thinking time, coding time, debugging time, and learning time***.
