# Problem Solving Training
Problem solving training for computer science students.

<br>

## [Level 1](https://github.com/cs-MohamedAyman/Problem-Solving-Training/tree/master/level-1)

This level simply consists of 9 sheets, 4 sheets of them on Codeforces Online Judge, plus 4 sheets on HackerEarth Online Judge, and the last sheet on HackerRank Online Judge.

## Prerequisites

The prerequisites for level 1 of this training are the basic knowledge for any programming language like ***(Variable Types - Basic Operators - Conditions - Loops - Functions - Lists - Strings)***.

	<summary>LeetCode OJ sheets description</summary>

The LeetCode OJ sheets [phase-3-1](https://github.com/cs-MohamedAyman/Problem-Solving-Training/tree/master/level-3/leetcode-phase-3-1), [phase-3-2](https://github.com/cs-MohamedAyman/Problem-Solving-Training/tree/master/level-3/leetcode-phase-3-2), [phase-3-3](https://github.com/cs-MohamedAyman/Problem-Solving-Training/tree/master/level-3/leetcode-phase-3-3), [phase-3-4](https://github.com/cs-MohamedAyman/Problem-Solving-Training/tree/master/level-3/leetcode-phase-3-4) contain search algorithms, sorting algorithms, divide and conquer algorithms, greedy algorithms, graph algorithms, and dynamic programming problems, and each sheet of them divided into 6 classes of problems (Binary Search - Divide and Conquer - Sort - Greedy - Graph - Breadth First Search - Depth First Search - Backtracking - Dynamic Programming). These sheets were ordered based on the problem difficulty and grouped by the problem type. Finally, each sheet contains ~200 problems.

### Notes

* If the student has a target to compete in the programming competitions like ***ACM-ICPC or Google Code-jam or Google Kick-start or Facebook Hackercup***, so it's recommended to start with ***Codeforces sheets*** and ***AtCoder sheets***, but if (s)he has a target to practice on ***a specific topic or preparing for an interview***, so it's recommended to start with ***HackerEarth sheets*** and ***HackerRank sheets*** and ***LeetCode sheets***.
* On each one of these sheets has an excel sheet to record your effort and enhance your progress, The time estimate for level problems is between ***30 min to 45 min*** for each problem, including ***reading time, thinking time, coding time, debugging time, and learning time***.
