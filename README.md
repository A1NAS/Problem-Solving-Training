# Problem-Solving-Training

Problem solving training for computer science students.

## Level 1

This [level](https://github.com/cs-MohamedAyman/Problem-Solving-Training/tree/master/level%201) simply consists of eight sheets, three of them on Codeforces OJ, plus four of them on HackerEarth OJ, and the last one on HackerRank OJ.

### Prerequisites

The prerequisites for level 1 of this training are the basic knowledge for any programming language like (Variable Types - Basic Operators - Conditions - Loops - Functions - Lists - Strings).

### [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/) OJ sheets

The Codeforces OJ sheets [codeforces - phase 1-1](https://github.com/cs-MohamedAyman/Problem-Solving-Training/blob/master/level%201/codeforces%20-%20phase%201-1.pdf), [codeforces - phase 1-2](https://github.com/cs-MohamedAyman/Problem-Solving-Training/blob/master/level%201/codeforces%20-%20phase%201-2.pdf), [codeforces - phase 1-3](https://github.com/cs-MohamedAyman/Problem-Solving-Training/blob/master/level%201/codeforces%20-%20phase%201-3.pdf) contain A-Div2 problems, and each sheet of them divided into 5 classes of problems (Basic Operators - Conditions - Loops - Lists - Strings). These sheets were sorted based on difficulty and grouped by the type of problems as mentioned. Finally, each sheet contains ~100 problems.

### Notes

* If the student has a target to compete in the programming competitions like ACM-ICPC or Codejam or Kick-start or Hackercup, so it's recommended to start with Codeforces sheets, but if (s)he has a target to practice on a specific topic or preparing for an interview, so it's recommended to start with HackerEarth and HackerRank sheets.
* On each one of these sheets has an excel sheet to record your effort and enhance your progress.
